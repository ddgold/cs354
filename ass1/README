Performance Tests:
1) solid = 18.01 sec, wire frame = 17.99 sec
2) 17.99 sec
3) 17.99 sec
4) solid = 18.00 sec, wire frame = 18.03 sec
5) 17.99 sec
6) 18.02 sec
7) 18.01 sec

    The performance tests for all 9 tests took roughly the same amount of time.
This is evident by the fact that the diference between the fastest and slowest
tests was only .04 seconds.  Based on this observation, it does not matter which
method you use to render these shapes, as they will all take about the same
about of time.  Choose the method of creation that is easieast for you to
implement.


Extra Credit:
    We added an extra display mode called UVsphere.  This mode renders a
calculated sphere.  As well, we implement new key bindings to change the number
of sectors used to produce the sphere.  'K' increase the longitude sections, and
'k' reduces these sections.  'L' and 'l' does the same for the latitude
sections.
